## 🧱 Project Structure

This project follows a **feature-based modular architecture** to enhance scalability and maintainability.

```
src/
├── features/         # Self-contained feature modules (e.g., auth, admin, scheduling)
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── admin/
│   └── ...
├── shared/           # Reusable code shared across features
│   ├── components/
│   ├── contexts/
│   ├── hooks/
│   └── ...
└── App.tsx           # Main application component and routing setup
└── main.tsx          # Application entry point
```

Each feature directory typically contains its own `components`, `pages`, `hooks`, and `contexts`, keeping feature-related logic encapsulated.
