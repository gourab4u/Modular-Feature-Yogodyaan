# Email to Google Trust & Safety Team - Verification Failed Issue

## Subject
Domain verification evidence for Yogodyaan - Verification Failed Despite Proper Implementation (Project: yogodyaan)

## Email Body

Hello Google Trust & Safety Team,

I am writing regarding the Google OAuth verification for our Yogodyaan application, which is currently failing despite having properly implemented all required elements including visible privacy policy and terms of service links on our homepage.

**Issue Summary:**
Though our privacy policy and terms of service links are clearly visible on our homepage footer and the pages are fully accessible through the provided links, the Google verification process is still failing. I have attached comprehensive evidence showing our compliance with all requirements.

**Project Details:**
- Domain: https://yogodyaan.site
- Project ID: yogodyaan
- OAuth Client ID: 196749664391-vdefv78ahi97j38f5bl9foegptf9nt96.apps.googleusercontent.com
- DNS TXT value added: google-site-verification=MiyWUfOivIrV6G74DySx0RXM-KJ7QGXMyvixZAqZzsE
- DNS provider: [FILL: e.g., Cloudflare / GoDaddy / Route 53]
- Date/time added (timezone): [FILL: timestamp when DNS record was added]

**Compliance Status:**
1. ✅ Privacy Policy page is live and accessible at https://yogodyaan.site/privacy
2. ✅ Terms of Service page is live and accessible at https://yogodyaan.site/terms
3. ✅ Both links are prominently displayed in the homepage footer under "Quick Links" section
4. ✅ Privacy Policy contains comprehensive Google OAuth data handling information
5. ✅ DNS TXT verification record has been properly configured
6. ❌ Google verification is still failing despite proper implementation

**Attached Evidence:**

**1. DNS Provider Screenshots:**
- DNS provider console screenshot showing the TXT record configuration
- Screenshot filename: `DNS_Provider_TXT_Record.png`

**2. DNS Verification Output:**
- Text file with dig/nslookup output confirming TXT record propagation
- Command used: `dig TXT yogodyaan.site +short` and `nslookup -type=TXT yogodyaan.site`
- Filename: `DNS_Verification_Output.txt`

**3. Privacy and Terms Pages Screenshots:**
- Screenshot of Privacy Policy page showing comprehensive content including Google OAuth compliance
- Screenshot filename: `PrivacyPolicy.png`
- Screenshot of Terms of Service page showing complete terms
- Screenshot filename: `TermsOfService.png`

**4. Homepage Footer Evidence:**
- Screenshot showing Privacy Policy and Terms of Service links clearly visible in footer
- Screenshot filename: `Homepage_Footer_Links.png`

**5. GCP Console Screenshots:**
- OAuth consent screen/branding page configuration
- Screenshot filename: `GCP_OAuth_Branding_Page.png`

**6. Verification Failed Screenshot:**
- Screenshot of the failed verification message from Google Console
- Screenshot filename: `Google_Verification_Failed.png`

**Additional Context:**
Our application is a yoga and wellness platform serving users who need to authenticate via Google OAuth for scheduling classes and accessing personalized content. The privacy policy has been specifically updated to include detailed information about Google authentication services, data handling, and user rights as required for OAuth compliance.

**Request for Assistance:**
Could you please review our implementation and provide specific guidance on what might be causing the verification failure? All required elements appear to be properly in place according to Google's documentation.

I am happy to provide any additional information or make any necessary adjustments to ensure compliance.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,  
Yogodyaan Team
