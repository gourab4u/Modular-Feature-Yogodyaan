Please run the migration to add transaction snapshot columns.

How to run (recommended)
1. Open Supabase → SQL Editor → New query
2. Paste the SQL from `supabase/migrations/20250829000001_add_transactions_snapshot.sql`
3. Run the query

After running, reply in this chat with exactly:
I ran migration

If you cannot run it now, reply:
I will run migration later

I will proceed with updating the edge function and frontend once you confirm "I ran migration" and toggle to Act mode.
